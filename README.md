# Scheduling Algorithms
To compile:
> g++ scheduler.cpp -o scheduler -pthread

To run:
> ./scheduler [arg1] [arg2]

* arg1 = number of processes for FCFS
* arg2 = number of process for priority scheduling

**Two** types of scheduling algorithms were implemented. The first being First Come First Serve and the second being priority based.
